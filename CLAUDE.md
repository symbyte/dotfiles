# Dotfiles Repository

## Source Control

This is a personal dotfiles repo - commit directly to main instead of using stacked PRs. No PR workflow needed.

```bash
# YES - commit directly to main
git add <files> && git commit -m "message"

# NO - don't use Graphite stacks for this repo
gt create ...
```
